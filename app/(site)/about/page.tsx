        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Pepe the Frog is a cartoon character that originated from the comic series "Boy's Club" created by artist Matt Furie in 2005. What started as an innocent character among friends quickly became an internet meme, gaining popularity on platforms like 4chan. Pepe's laid-back persona and various image variations spread across the internet, often accompanied by humorous captions. In 2008, the catchphrase "Feels good man" further solidified Pepe's presence within online communities. However, Pepe also faced controversies when associated with certain groups and ideologies during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Despite the negative connotations, efforts have been made to reclaim Pepe as a benign character. Through legal actions and discussions, the original intent and lightheartedness of Pepe are emphasized, acknowledging its significant role in internet culture.
